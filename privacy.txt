AllYourDice Privacy Policy

At the time of this writing AllYourDice does not collect any personal information about its users.  It just rolls dice.  

However this policy is also subject to change without warning.

As such we may some day collect information about how bad you are at rolling dice and mock you about it on twitter.

Seriously how can you fail at so many rolls in a row?  You failed a roll to tie your shoes!

Maybe you should try a different technique or some sort of athletic wristband.

Unless you're playing a vanilla mortal in In Nomine or Exalted in which case it's probably not your fault.
